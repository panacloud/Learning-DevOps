Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. 98% of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems. Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications. In this quarter we will learn embedded systems programming using Rust. We will learn how to write, build, flash and debug an \"embedded\" (Rust) program. Also the functionality (\"peripherals\") commonly found in microcontrollers: digital input and output, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), common communication protocols like Serial, I2C and SPI, etc. Multitasking concepts: cooperative vs preemptive multitasking, interrupts, schedulers, etc. Control systems concepts: sensors, calibration, digital filters, actuators, open loop control, closed loop control, etc. </p>"}},"certification":null,"textBooks":[{"title":"The Embedded Discovery Book","authors":"The Embedded Rust Community","url":"https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/"}],"referenceBooks":null,"sections":[{"title":"Advanced Rust Programming ","serialNumber":1,"weeks":"1, 2, and 3","quiz":{"title":"Advanced Rust Programming Quiz","week":4},"lineItem":[{"title":"Generics, Traits, Closures, and Threads","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Topics 10.1 of <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/</a>\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch10-02-traits.html#traits-as-parameters\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch10-02-traits.html#traits-as-parameters</a>\nTopics 10.2, 10.3, 13.1, and 16.1 of <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/</a></p>"}}}]},{"title":"Fundamentals of Embedded Rust Programming ","serialNumber":2,"weeks":"4, 5, and 6","quiz":{"title":"Embedded Rust Midterm Quiz 1","week":7},"lineItem":[{"title":"Hello World, LED, and Registers","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1, 5, and 6 of:\n<a href=\"https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/index.html\">https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/index.html</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html\">https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Binary.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Binary.html</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/rust_bitwise_operators\">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/rust_bitwise_operators</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer</a>  </p>\n<p>Note: Dereferencing a pointer means getting the value that is stored in the memory location pointed by the pointer.
